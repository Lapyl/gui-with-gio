# Teleprompter - Animation and interaction

## Goals

This project continues where the [egg timer](../egg_timer/) leaves off. The timer was a good start and gave us the foundation to build an app. But we're not done. Especially we should look closer at how how to deal with user input, both keyboard and mouse.

To do that we'll build what's known as a [teleprompter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprompter). A teleprompter is simply a device that displays and scrolls text. Sophisticated and expensive equipment exists, but it can just as easily be done with an app that displays and scrolls text. And that's the version we will build here. Since it needs to be lively and responsive for the user, it it's a great example for how we can react to keypresses and mouse scrolls. We'll make sure to look into some other new parts of Gio as well.

**Please note:**
We're not doing politics here. But when presenting this piece, it's more fun with famous speeches. And famous speeches are often given by, well, famous politicians. No matter your origin or partisanship, [Ronald Reagan's 1987 Berlin Wall Speech](https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/europe/100000006815729/reagan-berlin-wall.html) is among those, playing it's part in ending the cold war without the massive bloodshed the world feared. Both sides, East and West, deserve respect and praise for seeking and finding a mostly peaceful solution. Let us together repeat the best of our past, and learn from the worst. The future needs it.

On that note, let's (sc)roll!
